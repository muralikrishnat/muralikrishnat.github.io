Goal: Project Plan Generator

Context: I'm building tool to generate comprehenssive project plan based on the project requirements, 
    this plan will include all the details like discovery, implementation, testing, marketing, releases, deployments.

Task: Build app simple page with only html, w3c.css and javascript. 
this page takes project requirements in textarea or rich text editor from user.
another section to show complete project plan. it shouuld be very attractive display and very creative.

Below is the Project plan structure which you need to use to show:

UI Layout:

three rows, first row to collect project requirements and with button generate plan.
second row to show the process progress with all roles in horizontal step indicator 
where process progress will be moved from one role to another role, step indicator should be very creative.
third row to show the project plan.












Build web page with below features:

1. User provide project description.
2. Process to show converting the project description into detailed project plan with Epics, features and stories along with estimations.
3. Story has details like depends on, estimation story points, skill set, estimated sprint.
4. project description will go one by one AI agents like Technical Manager, Senior Architect, Business Analyst, Technical Lead, QA Lead, Dev Ops, Senior Dev...etc.,
5. The AI agent process will make sure all aspect of project implementation covered.
6. Make conversion process animated and progressive.
7. Feedback from AI agent during process pipeline.

=====instructions for app======
Use glassmorphic.
It should be simple, UI rich looking, with suitable font-awesome icons, easy to operate.
