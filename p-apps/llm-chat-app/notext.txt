Build me a super UI rich web page using only HTML, CSS and javascript.



Focus on UI look and feel and feature functionality, I wil take care of integration part and use functional approach for implementation so I should be able to integrate this page into React, use some dummy data to demo all functionalities.



This web page is to chat with LLMs similar to Gemini UI.



It should have below features:

- See list of chat history in the left side which is collapsable

- See chat window in the main section.

- Able to start a new Chat thread

- Able to choose the chat with option

* Vendor (Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Blackbox..etc.,)

* LLM Model (Flash, O1, Claude ,..etc.,)

* Agent Name (English teacher, Local Guide, Web developer...etc.,)

- Able to delete the chat from history bulk delete.

- Able to see chats as tabs in the top and able to switch between chats.
